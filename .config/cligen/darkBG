# A dark (black, really) bkgd color theme with purple..red rainbow/heatmap.
#
# This may not be helpful, or it may...Basically this is Roy.G.Biv in reverse
# (wavelength) order, dropping orange and replacing blue,indigo with cyan,blue.
#
# This kind of linear ordering on color is more useful for things like sizes or
# times that also have a natural order.

# WHITE on_black (fhue+ BHUE-).  Exchanged cases (fhueX BHUEX | FHUEX bhueX)
# are high contrast while +- flips polarity for fg/bg.  So, the two grays are:
# fhue- & FHUE+ (in order of contrast to bg) while fhue+ = bhue+,FHUE- = BHUE-.
